										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s hectic world, security is on everybody’s mind. Nobody likes leaving home if there’s potential for a burglary. Property owners and managers want residents to know their homes and personal possessions are secure. With MVI Systems’ KeyCom®, everyone’s safe and free from danger.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entire Property Control</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t do much good to secure one area of a property if you don’t secure them all. That’s a little bit like locking your windows but leaving the front door wide open. However, by using the KeyCom®, you’ll be certain the entire property is connected and protected. This system fully monitors a building’s activities and features by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing all activities in and around a building, including package deliveries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring visitor and guest access.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing any service requests, and facilitating communication between building staff and residents. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Access Control</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI’s KeyCom® video-intercom technology allows users to clearly see and control who has access to the building. Gone are the days of voice-only buzzer intercom systems. Those didn’t allow you to see who was at the door, and their sound quality left a lot to be desired. MVI System’s KeyCom® is a vast improvement, providing live video and top-notch audio quality that you can access conveniently from your smart phone. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seamless Communication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While security is of paramount importance, this system goes far beyond that. MVI’s platform also simplifies communication. Now, property managers and owners can notify all of their residents any time there are building updates with the press of a button! Just go to the management portal and select “Create New Notice.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">State-of-the-Art Technology</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The KeyCom® was created using state-of-the-art technology. This security system has the latest in facial recognition and artificial intelligence software built into a smart automatic video intercom system that can be accessed remotely from anywhere you are. That means neither staff nor residents need to be in the building to use it! For example, If a package is being delivered, postal carriers can simply use the security system to gain entry to the mailroom, drop off the package, and the correct resident will be notified that it has arrived. Likewise, if a resident has unexpected company stop by at an inopportune time, they can tell them it’s not a good time and deny access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s property owners, managers, and residents all appreciate having an easy-to-use video intercom security entry system. With MVI’s KeyCom®, they know they have the protection needed to be safe. </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/contact"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more about this revolutionary system! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of fumbling for your keys and running down to the lobby to let your friends in? Maybe you’re sick of having inefficient—or nonexistent—security in your apartment building. No matter what your gripe is with your apartment building, a brighter future is waiting in the form of a smart security system. With wonderful security and convenient features, all powered by smart technology, systems like the MVI KeyCom® are here to make things better.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a keyless entry system?</strong></h2>
<p>Keyless building entry systems are electronic access control systems that allow authorized users to access the building’s entryways without a traditional key. They can use methods as simple as a pin code, key fob, or key card, but some use higher-end tech like a mobile app, fingerprint or voice access, or facial recognition software. Keyless entry systems are also more aesthetically pleasing than conventional lock-and-key setups. According to Construction Dive, 86% of <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/millennial-renters-are-willing-to-pay-more-for-smart-home-tech/431477/">millennial owners and renters are willing to pay more</a> for a “smart unit” equipped with automated or remote-controlled devices like keyless entry.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the benefits of a keyless door entry system:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Convenience</strong></h2>
<p>With keyless entry systems for apartments, gone are the days of trying to find your key ring at the bottom of your packed purse or loaded backpack. Keyless smart access technologies available from MVI Systems provide convenient, safe access solutions for multifamily communities. Using a video intercom, mobile access, and visitor PINs, residents and management can manage all the activities and functions of a building from anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://mvisystems.com/how-it-works/">Check out how it works.</a></p>
<h2><strong>2. Security</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to their undeniable convenience, keyless building entry systems like MVI’s KeyCom® are designed to keep residents safe. They’re harder to get past than traditional key locks. In addition, they can restrict or grant access on a person-by-person basis. The KeyCom® includes state-of-the-art facial recognition and artificial intelligence software, offering enhanced security for any residential or commercial building.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Cost Savings</strong></h2>
<p>These systems can save property managers money by not having to pay for a front desk person or door guard. It also eliminates the need for extra keys, making it easier to manage access and reducing the risk of lost or stolen keys.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Improved Aesthetic and Perceived Value</strong></h4>
<p>Keyless entry systems represent a significant value-added feature to building residents. The same Construction Dive report referenced earlier indicates 61% of millennials are likely to pay more for an apartment specifically because of electronic access features. In a survey of <a href="https://wakefieldresearch.com/about-us/">Wakefield Research</a> using a sample of 1,000 renters in the US, a full 45% said they feel that physical door keys will be obsolete by 2026. In addition, 63% indicated they would move out of a building due to a lack of security.</p>
<p>Forward-thinking developers and property managers would be wise to consider carefully researched, developed, and tested keyless entry systems. They provide convenience, security, potential cost savings, and wide appeal to one of the largest markets in the rental sector.

<p>MVI Systems is a software development company whose innovative team of designers and engineers have created a revolutionary product for the residential multifamily building market: the patented KeyCom® Smart Video Door Kiosk and Software Platform. KeyCom® relies on a touchscreen monitor and smartphone apps to enable residents to interact with guests and visitors with touchless Bluetooth entry and digital keys, creating a user-friendly occupant experience and offering a more secure means for accessing properties. Unlike other video door systems, KeyCom® entry technology recognizes residents as they approach the system based on Bluetooth proximity-— enabling them to enter the building automatically in a matter of seconds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In big upscale buildings, it’s common practice to have a doorman. It’s their job to stand at the building’s main entrance helping people to quickly enter and exit. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">History of the Doorman</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doormen are also known as “porters&#8221; or “doorkeepers.” They’ve  been used from as far back as 200 BCE. In The United States, they are most often found in larger cities like Washington DC, Los Angeles, and New York City. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often said, “A good doorman sees everything and says nothing.” These men and women hold open doors for everyone coming and going; they bear witness to whatever happens in and around their buildings, and yet live by a motto of keeping mum about all of it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros of Living in a Doorman Building</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By always having a staff member on-site</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the safety of a doorman building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increases. Would-be criminals see someone guarding the entrance and walk away. The doorman is also able to screen visitors entering the building. This means residents won’t have unwanted company arriving at their doorstep uninvited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other potential pros include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doormen help residents and their guests by carrying luggage and groceries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concierge Services: An all-inclusive style building may have a concierge who acts as a service coordinator. Some days they might perform the duties of a doorman. Other days they may be making dinner reservations or arranging for limo services.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socialization: A doorman’s smile and friendly, “Hello,” can start you off on a happy note.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Events: Much like a concierge, a doorman will be able to keep residents apprised of what’s going on in the building and nearby in the neighborhood too.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons of Living in a Doorman Building</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many benefits to living in a building with a doorman there are also a few drawbacks. The most obvious is likely to be the cost. These buildings tend to be considered luxury-level and charge residents a higher rent to off-set the cost of having someone attend the building’s entrance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other potential drawbacks may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a doorman will block family members or friends from entering the building.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Privacy: Doormen can be the ultimate “busy-bodies.” They overhear many conversations, and you can bet they know all about exactly what’s going on in unit 2-C…</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This job has a high turnover rate, you won’t always know who that person is or what background checks they’ve gone through in order to get the job. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistent Service: Since no single person works 24 hours a day, a building may only have a doorman on duty during the busiest hours. On the other hand, they may have more than one doorman who rotates. While some may be fantastic, others may not be as competent. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem that can occur in doorman buildings is an increase in noise. This can be especially noticeable if your unit is on the ground floor. In buildings that aren’t manned, people tend to come and go quietly. However, in a doorman building, someone’s always striking up a conversation with whoever is standing vigil.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors To Consider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding if you want to live in or manage a building with a doorman there are many factors for you to take into account. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: Doorman buildings tend to only be available in larger cities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Amenities: Even in a building offering these services, they might not be provided 24 hours a day. The building might be better served by reallocating those financial resources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and providing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">other services and amenities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building size: Doorman buildings tend to be larger, and not everybody likes living in such a highly populated place. Those types of apartment buildings may also be more challenging to manage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type of Staff: What duties do the doormen perform and what other staff members are available? Some apartment complexes might be better served by offering housekeeping services in lieu of someone at the entrance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Policies and Rules: Some of these buildings with doormen are older and the atmosphere might be stuffy, They could have some older outdated rules or policies in place. If that’s the case, younger residents might not be as happy, and property managers might have a harder time with so many rules to enforce.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Security Options Available</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While doorman buildings are status symbols of luxury, they’re also expensive. Recently renters have found themselves having to live on tighter budgets. As the price of rent has increased, residents are now less likely to be willing to pay for services such as this.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a building’s security and the ability to have packages delivered properly are still extremely important!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully there are alternatives to doorman buildings. Electronic security systems allow you to see who’s coming and going. Access can be granted or denied remotely using a mobile device. This technology also allows package deliveries to be easily tracked, and residents can be quickly notified when their orders’ have arrived.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mvisystems.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can show you how a mobile security system can be installed to benefit your building. </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/contact-us/"><b>Contact us today!</b></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you familiar with the anxiety of knowing a package is waiting on your doorstep and could be stolen or damaged at any second? If not, you’re lucky. For the other 99% of us, it’s a big problem… Nobody wants that kind of stress, and that scenario is just one facet of the uncertainty of package delivery.</span></p>
<h2>Challenges of Package Delivery in Apartments</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, there are challenges in ensuring that a package reaches somebody living in an apartment building. Sometimes, it’s a simple matter of it being difficult for the postal delivery person to find the correct building or knowing where they’re actually supposed to leave the package. Many of us have had things delivered to us that were addressed to our neighbors, and many of us have been the neighbor in that situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the package is delivered to the correct address, there are still factors to contend with. Depending on the apartment building, there are rules for where to leave packages—at the door, on a table in the lobby, or in a designated mailbox. That doesn’t mean those rules will always be followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have to take into account the occasional delivery worker who simply leaves packages outside of the building altogether. Maybe they hide them behind a nearby bush or simply prop them against the door. When this happens, packages are at risk of being stolen or damaged by the elements should bad weather come knocking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also difficulties to consider around scheduling. If someone needs to sign for a package but isn’t home, they could play delivery tag with the mailman for several days. Ideally, noted delivery windows should be followed, but they can be ignored.</span></p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, with the MVI KeyCom®, these problems are nonexistent or easily solvable. Thanks to the ability to set up secure locations for drop-off packages, residents need not worry about losing their deliveries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Smart Video Door Platform has a state-of-the-art touchscreen that’s easy to use, for both residents and delivery workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to package delivery, our system and its key features provide residents with the ability:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know who’s right outside their door.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an instant notification about any delivery into our Package Room Solution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep track of packages received, but not yet retrieved.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Communicate! Just by using the app on their phone, they can see and talk to the person dropping off their package.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see if a package has been delivered.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep an eye on packages throughout the day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an MVI Video Security System in place, residents can be confident that their package will be safe!</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once upon a time, decent curb appeal, a washer and dryer in every unit, and perhaps a timely discount now and then were enough to attract potential residents to a multi-family property—and keep them renewing their leases year after year. As more young professionals and families choose to rent rather than buy, multi-family owners and operators must continue to offer high-value amenities for comfort and convenience, industry-leading software for safety and security, and best-in-class service and maintenance to stay at the head of the pack.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resident satisfaction is what a flourishing multi-family property business is built on. Keeping your residents satisfied depends on knowing what they are looking for in a property so you can make every effort to deliver it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following three strategies are some of the most effective ways to boost multi-family resident satisfaction and retention.</span></p>
<h2>Keep Amenities Updated</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large outdoor living spaces extend your tenants’ living space and provide comfortable places for entertaining or lounging. A rooftop deck (maybe even with an outdoor theatre or fire pit?) fits right in with the “moving outdoors” trend that young, single tenants and families are looking for, especially in urban areas. A 24-hour fitness center with virtual yoga, spin, and Zumba instructors is attractive to residents with flexible or unusual schedules. Conference rooms and office spaces, while more traditional amenities, are still attractive add-ons for existing and would-be residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on top of trends like these and adding them to your multi-family property will help you stand out from the competition and deliver the type of unique and attractive living experience that can only increase resident satisfaction.</span></p>
<h2>Invest in High-end Resident Safety and Security</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the most recent </span><a href="https://www.nmhc.org/research-insight/research-report/nmhc-grace-hill-renter-preferences-survey-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartment Resident Preference Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, today’s residents are demanding that their homes have the best safety and security features on the market. They want products like MVI’s </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/product-category/keycom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeyCom® Smart Video Kiosk and Software Platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a smart entry system designed specifically for </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/solutions/apartment-video-intercom-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-family</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building managers, residents, visitors, delivery staff, and maintenance workers. But the KeyCom® does much more than just get residents through the front door. Far more than a video intercom system, the KeyCom® kiosk allows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://mvisystems.com/solutions/building-video-intercom-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to receive and retrieve video and voice calls, send and receive text messages, grant access to the building, and manage their accounts using a smartphone or MVI’s Web Portal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors to use the KeyCom® touchscreen to scroll through the building directory, select an apartment, and either video chat with the resident or leave a video voicemail when they are unavailable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://mvisystems.com/package-room-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can access the building via the KeyCom touchscreen and deliver packages to a secured package location. No more lost or undeliverable packages!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintenance workers can be granted access to the building via the KeyCom® touchscreen at any time, without the need to constantly require the superintendent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owners and property managers can use the Web Portal to update tenant records and send building-wide announcements. Management can request detailed reports on events and access that have occurred in the building at any time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom line? Your residents want apartments with increased security. Slightly more than 61% say they are likely to rent an apartment specifically because of its electronic-access features, including keyless entry doors, and 55% are likely to pay more for an apartment that uses a “smart entry system.”  In fact, installing a smart entry system like MVI’s KeyCom® could be one of the most effective things you can do to improve customer satisfaction at your multi-family property.</span></p>
<h2>Stay on Top of Maintenance and Repairs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jturnerresearch.com/blog/press-releases/post/j-turner-research-reveals-top-10-apartment-resident-customer-satisfaction-c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey of 10,000 multi-family property residents by J Turner Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that the top three complaints they had involved maintenance and repairs. There’s never a good time for an HVAC system to break or a water heater to go on the blink, so forward-thinking owner/operators of multi-family properties know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Turner’s study showed a 20% increase in resident satisfaction properties where preventative maintenance was done on major systems and appliances</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing sought-after amenities, offering a leading-edge smart entry system, and developing a culture of service in your multi-family property are the keys to building resident satisfaction and long-term value.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you manage a single building or multiple properties, whether your daily visitors are in the dozens or the thousands, implementing a video entry system to your building will afford you maximum control over your premises and provide a safe environment for employees, residents, and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An effective visitor management system enhances the security of your shared building by providing a high-level overview of all types of visitors and giving them different levels of access. Our smart video entry systems use state-of-the-art technology to automate the tasks of traditional visitor management systems, delivering a contactless check-in experience that can more accurately and efficiently handle more visitors.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mvisystems.com/product-category/keycom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeyCom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">® is MVI’s state-of-the-art apartment building video intercom system. Securely operated on an intuitive web platform, KeyCom® allows you to control your building’s activities and features. With leading-edge facial recognition, artificial intelligence software, and touch-free access, KeyCom® is designed to keep your residents, tenants, and visitors safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI’s innovative team of designers and engineers have integrated increasingly sophisticated technology to their smart video door systems. These improvements have enhanced the functionality of these building entry systems, further upgrading the experience for residents, visitors, delivery personnel, maintenance, and management.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://mvisystems.com/solutions/building-video-intercom-system"><b>Residents</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents of </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/solutions/apartment-video-intercom-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-family buildings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use either their smartphones or MVI&#8217;s Web Portal to grant access to the building, send digital visitor keys, receive video and voice calls, send and receive text messages, retrieve video and voicemails and manage their accounts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Visitors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors use MVI’s KeyCom® touchscreen to scroll through the directory of the multi-tenant building to make a selection using the apartment or office number, tenant or family name, or any image uploaded to the multi-tenant video intercom system by the resident or tenant. Visitors are able to video-chat with residents or tenants or leave a video voicemail using the video intercom system.</span></p>
<h3><b>Delivery</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An access control system like the MVI KeyCom® directs delivery staff to an apartment or office building’s </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/package-room-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured package room</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Drivers use a touchscreen on the building entry system to access the secure package room, greatly reducing the number of lost or undelivered packages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Maintenance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repair and maintenance workers can be granted access to the building via the KeyCom® touchscreen in advance, making it unnecessary for them to be in constant contact with the superintendent while on the premises.</span><b> </b></p>
<h3><a href="https://mvisystems.com/solutions/commercial-video-intercom-system"><b>Management</b></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI’s video intercom system for apartment buildings allows managers to update tenant records and send residents messages, notifications, and schedules of upcoming events through the system’s Web Portal. Building owners and property managers have access to detailed building access events and reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increasing number of shared buildings and multi-family properties are updating their approach to visitor management with leading-edge building entry systems like MVI’s KeyCom®. Ease, convenience, and thoroughness of access control matters to tenants, residents, and visitors. Getting ahead of the curve with a state-of-the-art, user-friendly video intercom building entry system like MVI’s KeyCom® will save you money, improve efficiency, and keep your residents, visitors, and staff happy!</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property managers who have an </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/product-category/keycom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI KeyCom® Smart Video Door Kiosk and Security Platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helping to manage their properties already have the best security for apartment and multi-family buildings at their disposal. With the system’s ability to control a building’s activities and features, monitor visitor and guest access, manage service requests, and facilitate resident and staff communication, this state-of-the-art technology delivers unparalleled year-round apartment building security—and an extra measure of value during the holidays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Thanksgiving through New Year’s Day, when tenants are likely to be busiest, more guests are coming and going, and the number of deliveries to the building skyrockets, MVI’s KeyCom</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system helps apartment buildings stay safer and more secure by:</span></p>
<h3>1. Monitoring Guest Access</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are dozens of reasons to get together over the holidays, and that means a steady stream of visitors—many of them first-timers—coming in and out of your building. MVI’s KeyCom</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows guests to scroll through the building’s directory, select an apartment number, name, or icon, and request access to the building from the resident they intend to visit via video chat. </span></p>
<h3>2. Managing Package Delivery</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting the week of December 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the USPS expects to deliver 200 million packages before Christmas Day—that’s a jump of 33% over last year. As e-commerce sales continue to climb, KeyCom’s</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ability to deter package pirates, those thieves who take advantage of unattended packages sitting in hallways, lobbies, and foyers, becomes all-important. With our </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/package-room-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Package Room Solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, delivery drivers and couriers simply access the building using the touchscreen and deliver the parcels to a secure package location for later pick-up by residents. No more lost or undeliverable packages!</span></p>
<h3>3. Maximizing Resident Communication</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays bring with them a variety of situations that probably aren’t at play as often throughout the rest of the year: things like maximum occupancy limits, adherence to fire codes for indoor and outdoor décor, and the use of appliances like deep fryers that come out once a year to cook the turkey for a holiday meal. Savvy apartment managers use KeyCom’s</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> web portal to send building-wide messages to all residents, reminding them of the importance of adhering to holiday safety codes.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. </strong>Maximizing Communication with Maintenance</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclement weather and colder temperatures that often come with holiday time can cause frozen pipes, slippery sidewalks, and damage to roofs and gutters. Apartment managers can use the KeyCom’s</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> web portal to instruct maintenance staff to make sure that all their building&#8217;s safety equipment, from fire extinguishers to carbon monoxide detectors, is in good working order. This busy time of the year is also bound to bring with it more maintenance requests, including emergency work orders that need to be dealt with immediately for safety reasons. Again, apartment managers can use KeyCom</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to communicate these requests to their maintenance staff and manage their status to ensure that the complex stays safe and secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While residents may be aware of an apartment complex’s emergency plan, visitors or partygoers who are in the building for the first time likely do not. Take a few minutes to post a notice pointing out additional emergency exit signage. List essential phone numbers, including ways to contact property management in case of crisis no matter what time it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s time to upgrade your apartment complex’s security strategy in 2023, </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/demo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request a demo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from MVI to learn about some of the best options on the market. MVI is an industry leader in enhanced security for apartment building security year-round, and its state-of-the-art ability to audit door events, monitor package delivery, track and resolve maintenance requests and make communication effortless among residents and staff is especially valuable during the holidays when traffic skyrockets. Equipping a building or complex with MVI’s KeyCom</span><b>®</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides the best apartment security available and lets residents know that management values their security—24/7, 365 days a year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You want to ensure your residence is safe and secure when you’re away at work, enjoying family movie night, and especially when you’re asleep. <a href="https://mvisystems.com/">MVI Systems</a> can make that happen with our unsurpassed video intercom technology.</p>
<p>When a system is managed by the reception staff of your apartment complex, there is an instant boost of security. That’s peace of mind you can’t put a price tag on. Here are the benefits of a video intercom system and why MVI is the right choice for you.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>You want to communicate clearly with whoever is on screen. Our <a href="https://mvisystems.com/product-category/keycom">KeyCom® </a>line of products allows you to quickly and easily see visitors, give entrance access remotely, and instantly chat with the person at the door. That’s convenience and safety you can count on.</p>
<h3>Access Control</h3>
<p>For those who manage buildings, you need to monitor the comings and goings of everyone––it’s a lot to keep track of, isn’t it? In addition to monitoring entrance points, another perk of MVI’s family of products is that we can help you create a secure <a href="https://mvisystems.com/package-room-solutions">Package Room</a> solution. No more notes on residents’ doors, missed deliveries, or rogue packages. Only those who should be entering have access––period.</p>
<h3>Simple Communication</h3>
<p>The beauty of a cloudbased video system is that even from a smartphone, you can communicate with whoever is at your door, no matter where you are. You can grant access or quickly send them on their way: a convenience we all want to rely on.</p>
<h3>Deter Possible Problems</h3>
<p>Video monitoring can keep possible problems from becoming emergencies. When someone who may be a threat sees your video system, the last thing they want is to be on camera. When paired with other security measures, breaking in becomes more of a hassle than it’s worth, and that just might be what saves your life.</p>
<h3>Around the Clock Safety</h3>
<p>It’s one thing to have unrestricted access at entry points to an apartment complex during the day, but what about at night? Video intercom systems allow residents and their guests to gain access when doors are locked. Security can easily be reached through the intercom if after-hours visitors need assistance.</p>
<p>MVI Systems keeps up with the latest trends in access control systems, constantly improving technologies and integrations that allow building owners and property managers to enjoy streamlined, convenient security options. <a href="https://mvisystems.com/contact">Contact us today</a> for a FREE demo, and let us walk you through the world’s smartest video access system.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing fraud is a property management priority. The ability to screen potential residents is more sophisticated than ever, yet scammers are high-tech too. Now that more and more interactions occur online, how do you know someone is who they say they are? How do you prevent fraud when a property suddenly becomes a revolving door of residents not on the lease? </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud by the Numbers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenant fraud has always existed. When con artists have a will, they’ll find a way. The pandemic, eviction moratoriums, and mountains of sophisticated scam techniques have pushed the issue to the forefront for property managers and landlords. In numbers posted by the </span><a href="https://www.naahq.org/indicators-applicant-fraud-spike-during-pandemic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Apartment Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, between March 2020 and August 2020, fraud jumped close to 30 percent. High-risk applications spiked 15.2 percent compared to 10.3 percent just a year earlier. Those numbers tell the story of present times as well: we are in a season of multi-family tenant fraud. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Fraud</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property managers may recognize some of these scammer strategies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An applicant poses as someone else, providing false information when the real person has a history of poor credit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a false identity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential resident’s identity is authentic, yet some details have been tweaked. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tenant makes a little cash on the side by offering their location as a temporary rental, which breaks their lease agreement. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do you combat this? </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a Plan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your renters are who they say they are. It goes beyond business concerns. There is an ethical obligation for the </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/the-future-of-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security and safety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of everyone in the building. So, what plans should you put into place?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in tech that helps screen applications seamlessly and thoroughly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make full, legal names mandatory on all applications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrutinize all credit ratings and fraud alerts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check and double-check references and information.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sneaky Subletters</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-family properties should have smart, simplified security 24/7. Tenants who break the rules of their lease by subletting their space to others can go unnoticed by management, who already have a lot on their plates. Controlling a building’s activities with an intuitive web platform, including a state-of-the-art video intercom system, is the perfect solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI Systems’ </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/product-category/keycom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeyCom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ⓡ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to keep residents safe and features cutting-edge facial recognition and artificial intelligence software. Our products ensure that your residents are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">indeed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your residents with enhanced features, like:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building activity monitoring</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic building access via smartphone</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landlords and property managers can monitor and facilitate their buildings&#8217; access for residents and visitors with MVI Systems’ unsurpassed technology.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let MVI Shape Your Tenant Security </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVI, an </span><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/mvi_recognized_as_2021s_most_innovative_cost_saving_building_development_solution_by_new_world_report/prweb18347749.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">award-winning video-access control solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for commercial and multi-family properties, streamlines video access control solutions and innovative technologies to provide the highest level of security for buildings.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You already know that a video intercom system increases safety for the building’s occupants, but did you know that upgraded video access control systems will increase the value of commercial properties? Here are just a few ways that can happen with your </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/solutions/apartment-video-intercom-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or office building, medical practice, or warehouse.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Decreased Liability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having an automated system provide access control to your buildings, you decrease your liability if an incident does occur. You also increase the chances that a bad actor will be caught by law enforcement when your system allows recorded surveillance records from your entrances.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Reduced Theft and Vandalism</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video intercom systems deter </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/eliminate-porch-pirates-building-package-theft"><span style="font-weight: 400;">theft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and vandalism by making it more difficult for criminals to break in or damage the property undetected. Having these systems installed will most likely result in a would-be burglar moving on to a different, unprotected location.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Decreased Need for Security Personnel</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buildings without a controlled access system often find themselves paying for security services. Having an updated system monitoring parking lots and entrances means a lesser reliance on security personnel, which will ultimately save the property owners and managers money.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Perceived Safety</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A building that feels safe is a welcoming space for </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/5-ways-video-access-control-is-changing-the-tenant-experience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tenants and building occupants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and nothing provides that sense of security like an access control system. Tenants will actively </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/6-reasons-to-install-video-access-system-in-apartment-buildings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search for properties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that provide updated security features, choosing them over properties that don’t. They’re often willing to pay more to lease these properties.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Ease of Use Will Attract More Residents and Tenants</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A security system is only as good as the platform that fuels it. The days of struggling for keys, replacing lost keys, and having to change locks after residents move out are long gone thanks to upgraded security technologies. For MVI clients and customers, access control is at the tip of their fingers…literally. MVI’s patented </span><a href="https://mvisystems.com/products"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeyCom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ⓡ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer touch-free building access through the technology that everyone has in their pockets already; their smart device.</span></p>
